# Project 1
**Hypnophobia**

Hypnophobia represents a significant milestone in my academic journey, serving as the capstone project for my college graduation. Collaborating with a team of three talented individuals, comprising 
two developers and two 3D modelers, we undertook the task of creating this project from scratch, encompassing various aspects, including textures, sounds, and visual elements.
